# BossFight Game

This is a simple JavaScript code exercise for creating a boss fight game, inspired by Dungeons & Dragons (DnD) style battles.

## Game Idea
The game revolves around a simple web page where a hero fights against a boss. Both the hero and the boss have melee weapons and two spell slots. Hits and damage are determined by rolling dice. When either the hero's or the boss's HP (health points) reach 0, the game ends. During their turn, the player decides whether to use melee or a spell. The boss randomly chooses between melee and a spell until its spell slots are exhausted, after which it only uses melee attacks.

## Learning Goals / Why I Did This
- Learning JavaScript
- Understanding how to integrate JavaScript with HTML
- Practicing Git version control

## How to Play
1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the game.
3. During your turn, choose whether to attack with melee or a spell.
4. Wait for the boss to take its turn.
5. Continue until either the hero or the boss has 0 HP.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap

## Possible future Improvements
- Adding more spells and abilities for both the hero and the boss.
- Updating the UI to be more visually appealing
- Adding sound effects and animations to enhance the gaming experience.
- Adding a scoring system or levels to increase replay value.
